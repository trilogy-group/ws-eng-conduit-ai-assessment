# Running in Gitpod

Gitpod offers a browser-based VSCode interface with pre-configured terminal tasks to seed the database and start the application. 

Here, "localhost" refers to the remote machine. All "localhost" ports are exposed to a Workspace-specific URL, which is automatically opened if you press any localhost link from the Gitpod terminal, output pane, editor, etc. To open the UI, you can press the `http://localhost:4200/` link in the App terminal (printed once the Angular app spins up) or, alternatively, you can type `gp url 4200` in a new terminal to find the URL manually. 

Lastly, if you need to upload a file from your local machine, simply drag and drop the file or right click on the folder --> Upload.

Some Firefox users face a "Security Error" when opening Gitpod; see [this issue for details and workarounds](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9386).

If you are inactive for a while, your Workspace will be "paused". All file changes that you have made to the repository will be saved. You can resume it by refreshing the link or by going here: https://gitpod.io/workspaces.
